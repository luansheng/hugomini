## Biography
My research is on the areas of shrimp and fish selective breeding. I am interested in design of genetic improvement programs, development of breeding objectives, selection strategies, and genetic evaluation systems. Currently, my research is focused on estimating genetic parameters for additive, non-additive and indirect genetic effects, predicting selection response, and designing mating scheme for economically important traits in shrimp and fish.

## Interests
* Selective breeding program for shrimp and fish
* Indirect genetic effect for breeding object traits in shrimp
* Genetic evaluation by GBLUP or ssGBLUP in shrimp
* Application of optimum contribution in shrimp and fish
* Linear mixed effects for animal breeding
* Exploratory data analysis and reproducible genetic evaluation with R

## Education
* PhD in marine biology, 2006
* Ocean University of China
