## Biography

My research is on the areas of shrimp and fish selective breeding. I am interested in design of genetic improvement programs, development of breeding objectives, selection strategies, and genetic evaluation systems. Currently, my research is focused on estimating genetic parameters for additive, non-additive and indirect genetic effects, predicting selection response, and designing mating scheme for economically important traits in shrimp and fish.

## Interests

-   Design the selective breeding program for shrimp and fish
-   Genomic selection and GWAS for important economic traits in shrimp
-   Indirect genetic effect for target traits in shrimp
-   Genetic evaluation for uniformity in shrimp
-   Application of optimum contribution in shrimp and fish

## Education

-   PhD in marine biology, 2006
-   Ocean University of China
